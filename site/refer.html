<p id="style"> As part of this demonstration, I'm obviously going to use some git commands in order to commit, in order to save, and in order to upload our code that is locally in our machine to github.com. Now, I highly encourage you to actually learn get pretty in-depth. I'm not going to have a whole course here in just a lecture or so on Git, I will carry give you enough of the commands so you'll be able to be functional. But I would very highly encourage you to go and read it at least through the branches chapter of the Git book. And the way you could do that is it's free online. You can just say Git book. If you say Git book, the very first thing you should come up as this Git book link. And this is a book that if you wanted to actually get a PDF or you could read the entire thing online.</p>
